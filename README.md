# Calculator
An advanced calculator using command line arguments to calculate multiple numbers. I has operators like (+-*/) and can calculate numbers upto aprroximately 1 billion.)

--> If exit status is equal to 1 it means that the number is greater than 1 billion or your stament is incomplete like (1 + 2 /).

--> If exit status is equal to 2 it means you are trying to divide by zero which is invalid.

--> If exit status is equal to 3 it means the operator is not among (+ , - , * ,/).

Syntax : ./calculator num1 op1 num2 op2 num3 op3 num4 ...

For example : you can type like this in command prompt after compiling the code. --> ./calculator 1 + 3 / 2 * 99 - 59
